how to install dangen

* requirement

To compile dangen, you need:

1) a C library (libc) (GNU C Library is known to work)
2) the Simple DirectMedia Layer library (libSDL)
3) SDL_image (libSDL_image)

To hack dangen, you also need:

1) autoconf
2) automake
3) flex
4) bison

* installation commands

dangen follows the standard 3-step installation process, that is:
1) ./configure
2) make
3) make install

* ./configure options

** --with

--without-posix
Don't use _most_ (not all) of the POSIX features, that is:
  - You must NOT run "make install" --- I don't know where I put necessary
    files on a non-POSIX system.
  - Image data are loaded from the directory spqr/image/ in the current
    directory.
  - High score data are saved in the directory save/ in the current directory.
  - The directory where high score data are saved (that is, "save/") is
    not created by dangen.  You must create it manually before invoking dangen.
  - All install directory options (see below) are ignored.
    In short, you should invoke dangen as "./dangen" from the top directory of
    the source tree.
DON'T USE THIS OPTION UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  dangen is
designed for a POSIX system.

** install directories

--prefix
Everything will be installed here by default.

--bindir
The executable will be installed in this directory.

--datadir
The image files (spqr/image/*.png) will be installed in its
subdirectory games/dangen/ .

--mandir
The manpage will be installed in its subdirectory man6/ .


The FHS way will be something like:
./configure --prefix=/usr --bindir=/usr/games \
  --mandir=/usr/share/man

If you have no root privilege and want to install dangen under
your home directory, try:
./configure --prefix=/home/oohara/temp/dangen
Replace /home/oohara/temp/dangen as appropriate.  Note that
these directories must be specified in their absolute path.
